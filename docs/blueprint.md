## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark gray (#121212) to create a modern and immersive atmosphere, reducing eye strain.
- Primary color: Vibrant purple (#A060FF) to highlight interactive elements and the app's brand, reflecting creativity and energy.
- Accent color: Light blue (#60A0FF), an analogous hue to purple, providing a contrasting highlight for key interactive elements like play button.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font, will be used for both headlines and body text. Its neutral, modern appearance supports readability and suits the app's contemporary style.
- Employ a minimalist design focusing on ease of use, with clear, large controls and readable text, all optimized for a comfortable user experience in a dark theme.
- Incorporate subtle, smooth transitions and animations (e.g., fading effects when changing songs or displaying lyrics) to enhance the appâ€™s fluidity without being distracting.
- Use simple, clean icons, likely in a neon style or outline form, in the light blue accent color (#60A0FF), to maintain visual clarity and consistency with the dark theme and vibrant purple accents.
